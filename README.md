# Maven Cleanup

`mcup` /m'kÊŒp/ (**m**aven **c**lean **up**) is a command line tool to keep your local maven repository small ðŸ“¦ and tidy
ðŸ§¹.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a great tool to build software for Java and other languages running on the JVM. At
its core Maven is a dependency manager that downloads and stores dependencies in a local repository. Over time, this
repository grows and takes up more and more space on the hard disk. It often contains obsolete versions or dependencies
that are no longer needed.

`mcup` helps you to clean up your local repository. It uses filters to select artifacts based on the Maven coordinates
`groupId`, `artifactId` and `version`. It knows three modes:

1. analyze and report the size of the artifacts selected by the filters
2. remove all artifacts selected by the filters and keep the rest
3. keep all artifacts selected by the filters and remove the rest

# Installation

[Precompiled binaries](https://github.com/hpehl/mcup/releases) are available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Cargo

```shell
cargo install mcup
```

## Brew

```shell
brew tap hpehl/tap
brew install mcup
```

## Shell Completion

The repository contains shell completion files for bash, fish, zsh, elvish, and PowerShell. To install them:

* for bash, copy `completions/mcup.bash` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bash_completion` or `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.
* for fish, copy `completions/mcup.fish` to `~/.config/fish/completions/`.
* for zsh, copy `completions/_mcup` to one of your `$fpath` directories.
* for elvish, install `completions/mcup.elv` with [epm](https://elv.sh/ref/epm.html)
* for PowerShell, add `completions/_mcup.ps1` to your PowerShell profile.

# Usage

```shell
mcup [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```

### Flags

* `-r, --releases` Selects released artifacts only

* `-s, --snapshots` Selects snapshot artifacts only

* `-h, --help` Prints help information

* `-V, --version` Prints version information

## Options

* `-g, --groups <GROUPS>` Selects artifacts based on the group ID.

  Subgroups are included by default.

  | Group            | Selection                                                                 |
  |------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | org              | All groups starting with 'org' (including 'org')                          |
  | org.wildfly      | All groups starting with 'org.wildfly' (includes 'org.wildfly)            |
  | org.wildfly.core | All groups starting with 'org.wildfly.core' (includes 'org.wildfly.core') |

* `-a, --artifacts <ARTIFACTS>`  Selects artifacts based on the artifact ID.

  Supports globbing like in `maven-*-plugin` (see https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/ for more details).

  | Artifact     | Selection                          |
  |--------------|------------------------------------|
  | wildfly-core | Artifact 'wildfly-core' only       |
  | \*wildfly\*  | All artifacts containing 'wildfly' |

* `-v, --versions <VERSIONS>` Selects artifacts based on version (ranges).

  Use `<n>..` to select the _n_ most recent versions, `..<n>` to select the _n_ oldest versions and `<version>` to
  select one specific _version_ only.

  | Version | Selection                  |
  |---------|----------------------------|
  | 1..     | The latest version         |
  | 5..     | The 5 most recent versions |
  | ..1     | The oldest version         |
  | ..4     | The 4 oldest versions      |
  | 1.2.3   | Version 1.2.3              |

* `-l, --local-repository <LOCAL_REPOSITORY>` Sets the location of the local maven repository.

  `mcup` respects the configuration of the local repository according
  to https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-maven.html#configuring-your-local-repository.

  The location of the local repository is computed in this order:

    1. The value of the option `--local-repository`
    2. The value of `<localRepository/>` in `~/.m2/settings.xml`
    3. Fall back to `~/.m2/repository/`

## Subcommands

### Disk Usage (`du`)

Use this subcommand to analyze the disk usage of the artifacts selected by the filters. The subcommand accepts the same
filters as the `keep` and `rm` subcommands, but does not remove any artifacts. Instead, it selects the artifacts matched
by the filters and calculates the size of the groups, artifacts, and versions.

The subcommand accepts the following options:

* `-o, --output <OUTPUT>` Defines whether (g)roups, (a)rtifacts, and (v)ersions are included in the usage summary.
  Defaults to `ga`.

See the [DU page](DU.md) for more information and sample outputs.

### Keep / Remove (`keep`, `rm`)

Use one of these subcommands to remove artifacts selected by the filters:

* `keep` Keeps the artifacts matched by the filters and removes the rest
* `rm` Removes the artifacts matched by the filters and keeps the rest

The subcommands accept the following flags:

* `-d, --dry-run` Does not remove artifacts

* `--list` Prints the full path to the artifacts that will be removed.

  Use this flag together with `--dry-run` to review or post-process artifacts that will be removed:

  ```shell
  mcup --versions '3..' keep --dry-run --list > artifacts.txt
  ```

# Filter Combinations

For subcommands `keep` and `rm` at least one of `--releases`, `--snapshots`, `--groups`, `--artifacts` or`--versions` is
required, where `--releases` and `--snapshots` are mutually exclusive.

Subcommand `du` has the same semantics as `rm`, but doesn't require a filter.

If `--groups` is specified together with any other filter, only artifacts *below* the matched (sub)groups are
subject to the subcommands (`du`, `keep` or `rm`). Artifacts *outside* the matched (sub)groups won't be touched.

The following table explains the different filter combinations and describes which artifacts are analyzed, kept, or
removed.

| Filter                                | du                                                                               | keep                                                                                                    | rm                                                                                                      |

| `--artifacts` only                    | Analyzes the specified artifacts.                                                | Keeps the specified artifacts and removes anything else.                                                | Removes the specified artifacts.                                                                        |
| `--versions` only                     | Analyzes the specified versions.                                                 | Keeps the specified versions and removes anything else.                                                 | Removes the specified versions.                                                                         |
| `--groups` plus any other filter      | Analyzes the artifacts matched by the filters *below* the specified (sub)groups. | Keeps the artifacts matched by the filters *below* the specified (sub)groups and removes anything else. | Removes the artifacts matched by the filters *below* the specified (sub)groups and keeps anything else. |
| All other combinations w/o `--groups` | Analyzes the artifacts matched by the filters.                                   | Keeps the artifacts matched by the filters and removes anything else.                                   | Removes the artifacts matched by the filters.                                                           |
